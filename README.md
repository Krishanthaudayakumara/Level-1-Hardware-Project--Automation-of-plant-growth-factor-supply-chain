<h3>UOM Level 1 Hardware project</h3>

<h2> Project Title: Automation Of The Plant Growth Factor Supply Chain </h2>
<br>
Description: <br><br>
This project is a hardware solution that measures and records the environmental factors and supply deficit factors for plants. The project uses an Atmega32 microcontroller, other sensors, and components to build the project. The project is programmed using the C language.

The project aims to automate the plant growth factor supply chain by measuring and recording the environmental factors that affect plant growth. The project also measures the supply deficit factors for plants, such as the amount of water, nutrients, and light that plants need. The project can then be used to automate the delivery of plant growth factors to plants, ensuring that plants have the right amount of the right factors to grow healthy.

The project was built using an Atmega32 microcontroller, which is a small, low-cost microcontroller that is commonly used in embedded systems. The microcontroller was programmed using the C language, which is a popular programming language for embedded systems. The project also uses a variety of sensors, such as a light sensor, a temperature sensor, and a humidity sensor. These sensors are used to measure the environmental factors that affect plant growth.

The project was successfully completed and has the potential to automate the plant growth factor supply chain. The project can be used to improve the growth and health of plants, and it can also be used to reduce the cost of plant growth.
